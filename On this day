On this day,
I am filled more with questions and feelings than with answers

On this day,
The clouds are dark, just finished offloading her water to the world

On this day,
I have consumed more than I have created

On this day,
I have created in spite of the fear

On this day, 
I have set down my foot on this journey of life
