To this day,
I have questioned myself

1
She would say maybe

On this day,
I am filled more with questions and feelings than with answers

2
He would say no

To this day,
I have wondered who the sun is out to play with

3
They would say never

On this day,
The clouds are dark, just finished offloading her water to the world

4
Faith will say yes

To this day,
I have taken more than I have given

On this day,
I have created in spite of the fear

On this day, 
I have set down my foot on this journey of life

It sometimes would work
