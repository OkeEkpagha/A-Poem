To this day,
I have questioned myself

On this day,
I am filled more with questions and feelings than with answers

To this day,
I have wondered who the sun is out to play with

On this day,
The clouds are dark, just finished offloading her water to the world

To this day,
I have taken more than I have given

On this day,
I have created in spite of the fear

On this day, 
I have set down my foot on this journey of life
